# Twitter-Stream-API-in-python

This app opens the server to Twitter Streaming API (statues/sample) to gather tweets in custom time

after it gathers all the tweets, it parses 'text' (tweet text) out from the tweets 

separate each tweet word by words, filter thru blacklist(stopwords)

then count the total number and topten most used words in them! :D
